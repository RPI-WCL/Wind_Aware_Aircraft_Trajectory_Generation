# Wind_Aware_Aircraft_Trajectory_Generation 

##### This is the companion code for [Wind-Aware Trajectory Planning For Fixed-Wing Aircraft in Loss of Thrust Emergencies.](http://http://wcl.cs.rpi.edu/papers/DASC_18.pdf "Research Paper")

##### Versions:
* v_h.1 - generates wind-aware trajectories.

* There are two things that can be done with this software:

	- Modeling the effect of wind on trajectories
